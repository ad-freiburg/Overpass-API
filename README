This fork adds the following changes:

 * time limit is never checked against global available time. Anything goes.
 * total available memory limit is set to the total system memory size.
 * The default values for time and mem limit of a query are kept. To use more memory, you have to specify the max time limit and memory in the query. CAREFUL: there is no way to kill a query. If you set a time limit of 24 hours for a very large query, it will run for 24 hours.
